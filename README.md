# skill-test1

## Description

A PSD to HTML conversion, I was given a file from which I extracted the images. The instructions called for the site to be fully responsive, and for the carousel to convert to an accordion when on a mobile screen. I used a snippet from bootsnipp.com to make the carousel responsive and bootstrap for the accordion.
